    remember when it was cool to check out the source code? yeah. me too.
    there was this one time I even got an email from someone about how nicely indented my code was.
    but, you know, I'd rather be out for a bike ride these days.

            <p>Howdy! Tech sure has changed a lot since I started tinkering around with it in the 90s. I've changed a lot too! After many iterations of blogs and homepages, these days I'm keeping it pretty simple on a couple of social sites. Glad you popped by&#8212;feel free to follow me on one of these social platforms or send me an old fashioned email.</p>
